Until recently, I believed that "being in-love" was some kind of fairy tale. Something to help sell products. Something that was the result of a full-blown brainwashing campaign created by the capitalists and propagated through old-school Disney princesses. Something that the venerable Bernie Sanders surely didn't stand for. What can I say? I'm a cynic -- and my life had never manifested the "being in love" experience. To me, it seemed far more plausible to believe that the ridiculously profitable love-oriented commercial market was preying off of our unfulfilled artificial longings. Yeah... rough, I get it. 

It wasn't long ago that I started really evaluating this feeling and idea of "being in-love". It all started when I was practicing [metta][0] (loving-kindness) meditation. For those of you who have never practiced metta -- it is essentially a meditation where you do your best to conjure up feelings of compassion and love to yourself and others. As I practiced, I found my capacity to feel and express loveing-kindness expanded - far beyond what I considered possible for this lost soul. I found myself feeling better and better about everything, and the loveing-kindness I experienced in life slowly expanded. Not just how kind I was able to be -- but how kind people were to me. 

In one of these meditations, I was feeling rebellious. Life was rough. I was discouraged that I would be alone forever. I "knew" that I was an emotionally unavailable prick who didn't have a snowball's chance in hell of even pretending to be in love. From this place, I started wondering if I could conjure the feeling of being in love -just to see what that felt like. I wanted to dig in to the feeling to see if it was even a reality that existed within in me.

I would start by taking several centering breaths.

Breathing
in, I am aware that I am breathing in a long breath.

Breathing out, I am aware that I am breathing out a long breath.

Breathing in, I am aware that I am breathing in a short breath.

Breathing out, I am aware that I am breathing out a short breath.

Breathing in, I am aware of my entire body.

Breathing out, I am aware of my entire body.

Breathing in, I calm the sensations of the body.

Breathing out, I calm the sensations of the body.

From
there, I was focus on feeling the experience of being in love with
someone with each inhale and exhale.

Breathing
in, what would it feel like to be deeply in love?

Breathing out, what would it feel like to be deeply in love?

Breathing in, I feel the experience of being deeply in love.

Breathing out, I feel the experience of being deeply in love.

Breathing in, I explore the feeling of being in love.

Breathing out, I explore the feeling of being in love.

I
did not focus on what actions would I perform, or what she looked
like, or what our first date would be -- but the actual feeling of
being deeply in love. At first, I had to draw from moments where I
felt a spark of something. From there, and each practice onward, I
would do my best to find where I left off and "fan the flame" so
to speak. I would simply experience the physical sensation over my
heart and breathe into it. I'd set a timer and do this about 10
minutes a day. Since, in my mind, I had no hope of experiencing these
feelings naturally -- I decided to simply enjoy the sensations I
created internally. If there is one thing that the bad buddhist is
good at, it is self-pleasure. I was attempting to fill the emotional
void left by empty (non-destructive) sex and lots of masturbation.
Pretty pathetic, I know -- but it was time well sepent. 

_**Breaking news!!!**_

Fast forward almost a year -- and I am starting to feel these feelings as part of my day-to-day experience. I'll say it -- **the bad buddhist is in love**. Deeply in love. 

Last night, I decided to give me "what does it feel like to be in love?" meditation a go once again. Because the feelings of being in love have made their way into daily life -- I have been focusing my meditations on other things. Coming back to this practice was breathtaking. The stream of love that I felt flowing threw me to begin my mediation was intense -- but after fanning the flame for 10 minutes -- the only words that can describe the experience was heart-opening. 

Today, all of the space I had created in my heart became fully encompassed. I am now convinced that the more space you make available in your life for love, the more love will rush in to fill the space you create. 

Energy attracts like energy. My year of practicing "what does being in love feel like?" prepared me for where I am today. I am now convinced that you must condition your heart to give and receive love. The more you practice "fanning the flame", the more love you are able to experience and share. 

So, if you are a miserable and lonely lump of a person -- much like what I considered my standard mode of operation -- **start asking yourself what being in love feels like, and sit with it.**

Do
this a few times a week for at least 10 minutes a session. I think
you will find yourself receiving more love than you knew possible.
