Hello everyone, I'm a bad Buddhist. A really shitty one, in fact. Although I love the essence of the Buddha's teaching, the only reason I claim the title is for the instant street cred in my yoga classes - which definitely gets me laid. I'm rarely present, I love intoxicants, I'm divorced, I find women immensely beautiful, am - generally speaking - a fan of sensual pleasures, and worst of all -- I refer to myself a lot. Which seems to be as good as saying that there is no dharma. I am truly lost in a world of my own ill-being.

I'm an ego-maniac with a pension for saying "I told you so". I love being right at your expense. I've been called an asshole on more occasions than I can count on my favorite hand. I love a good stiff drink after a long day's work. I enjoy an evening of debauchery with my friends. I don't want to settle - because I am special. Period. You - maybe not so much - but I definitely am. Rules don't apply to me for I have transcended. 

Yet, when by myself, I feel like life is passing me by. I may be good at lots of things. I may have a kick-ass job, a nice home, a beautiful daughter, a decent-enough ex-wife, all of the inherit privileges that come along with being a middle-class white guy in the tech industry. I might even give women mind blowing orgasms, yet - most of the time - I feel completely empty - and not in the Zen way. 

However, there is this constant bell of mindfulness in my life. My daughter E. She reminds me of how great a simple life can be and how joy or ultimate sorrow can be manifest in the turn of a moment. Simply by watching her and being present with her -- I learn so much.

I'm a no bullshit kind of guy. I love the teachings of the Buddha, but I am not about to give up my happy hour. I might reign it in a little - but I am not about to stop pursing the seductive beauty of beautiful women. Let's get real - what is life without a little bit of craving?

... I think you may now be seeing why I am titling this as "Bad Buddhist". I have been wanting to write about the teaching of the Buddha for years - but just couldn't bring myself to do it. I am NOT a teacher, just an observer and a pretty shitty practitioner. Yet, for some damn reason, I stick with it. I guess you could say that it gives me hope.

This site chronicles my quest to find balance and meaning in my life. I don't believe in God, but I can't let go of purpose. Liberation is my aim, not just for me -- but for my family. Past and present. I hope we can all learn from my fuck-ups and insights to find ways to make life just a little bit better. That would make it worth it. Also, I really like reading my own words. Also, maybe this will give others the courage to get real and say things how they really are. As the great Tom Waits says:

"Get down off the cross, we could use the wood. Come on up to the house."

"Great wisdom comes from those who aren't afarid to get their hands dirty" - Me

Here's what I have to say. Take it or leave it.
