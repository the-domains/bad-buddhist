<p>Until recently, I believed that “being in-love” was some kind of fairy tale. Something to help sell products. Something that was the result of a full-blown brainwashing campaign created by the capitalists and propagated through old-school Disney princesses. Something that the venerable Bernie Sanders surely didn't stand for. What can I say? I'm a cynic – and my life had never manifested the “being in love” experience. To me, it seemed far more plausible to believe that the ridiculously profitable love-oriented commercial market was preying off of our unfulfilled artificial longings. Yeah… rough, I get it. </p><p>It wasn't long ago that I started really evaluating this feeling and idea of “being in-love”. It all started when I was practicing <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/meditation-for-strivers">metta</a> (loving-kindness) meditation. For those of you who have never practiced metta – it is essentially a meditation where you do your best to conjure up feelings of compassion and love to yourself and others. As I practiced, I found my capacity to feel and express loveing-kindness expanded - far beyond what I considered possible for this lost soul. I found myself feeling better and better about everything, and the loveing-kindness I experienced in life slowly expanded. Not just how kind I was able to be – but how kind people were to me. </p><p>In one of these meditations, I was feeling rebellious. Life was rough. I was discouraged that I would be alone forever. I “knew” that I was an emotionally unavailable prick who didn't have a snowball's chance in hell of even pretending to be in love. From this place, I started wondering if I could conjure the feeling of being in love -just to see what that felt like. I wanted to dig in to the feeling to see if it was even a reality that existed within in me.</p><p>I would start by taking several centering breaths.</p><p>Breathing
in, I am aware that I am breathing in a long breath.</p><p>Breathing out, I am aware that I am breathing out a long breath.</p><p>Breathing in, I am aware that I am breathing in a short breath.</p><p>Breathing out, I am aware that I am breathing out a short breath.</p><p>Breathing in, I am aware of my entire body.</p><p>Breathing out, I am aware of my entire body.</p><p>Breathing in, I calm the sensations of the body.</p><p>Breathing out, I calm the sensations of the body.</p><p>From
there, I was focus on feeling the experience of being in love with
someone with each inhale and exhale.</p><p>Breathing
in, what would it feel like to be deeply in love?</p><p>Breathing out, what would it feel like to be deeply in love?</p><p>Breathing in, I feel the experience of being deeply in love.</p><p>Breathing out, I feel the experience of being deeply in love.</p><p>Breathing in, I explore the feeling of being in love.</p><p>Breathing out, I explore the feeling of being in love.</p><p>I
did not focus on what actions would I perform, or what she looked
like, or what our first date would be – but the actual feeling of
being deeply in love. At first, I had to draw from moments where I
felt a spark of something. From there, and each practice onward, I
would do my best to find where I left off and “fan the flame” so
to speak. I would simply experience the physical sensation over my
heart and breathe into it. I'd set a timer and do this about 10
minutes a day. Since, in my mind, I had no hope of experiencing these
feelings naturally – I decided to simply enjoy the sensations I
created internally. If there is one thing that the bad buddhist is
good at, it is self-pleasure. I was attempting to fill the emotional
void left by empty (non-destructive) sex and lots of masturbation.
Pretty pathetic, I know – but it was time well sepent. 
</p><p><i><b>Breaking news!!!</b></i></p><p>Fast forward almost a year – and I am starting to feel these feelings as part of my day-to-day experience. I'll say it – <b>the bad buddhist is in love</b>. Deeply in love. </p><p>Last night, I decided to give me “what does it feel like to be in love?” meditation a go once again. Because the feelings of being in love have made their way into daily life – I have been focusing my meditations on other things. Coming back to this practice was breathtaking. The stream of love that I felt flowing threw me to begin my mediation was intense – but after fanning the flame for 10 minutes – the only words that can describe the experience was heart-opening. </p><p>Today, all of the space I had created in my heart became fully encompassed. I am now convinced that the more space you make available in your life for love, the more love will rush in to fill the space you create. </p><p>Energy attracts like energy. My year of practicing “what does being in love feel like?” prepared me for where I am today. I am now convinced that you must condition your heart to give and receive love. The more you practice “fanning the flame”, the more love you are able to experience and share. </p><p>So, if you are a miserable and lonely lump of a person – much like what I considered my standard mode of operation – <b>start asking yourself what being in love feels like, and sit with it.</b></p><p>Do
this a few times a week for at least 10 minutes a session. I think
you will find yourself receiving more love than you knew possible.  </p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="29"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="30"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="31"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="32"><span data-reactid="33"><!-- react-empty: 34 --><h2 data-reactid="35"><a data-reactid="36">Bad Buddhist</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="37"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="38"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="39"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="40"></div></section></div></div>
