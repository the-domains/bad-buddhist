<p>We are stardust in the form of clouds...</p><p>If you are looking for an analogy to best describe the inner workings of reality, look to the sky. At night, if the clouds permit, we are slapped in the face one of the most incredible truths – all of those little dots are stars – and what we see is just the tip of the universe. We are made of “star-stuff”. We are those stars, and those stars are us. </p><p>When we look at the stars – our perceptions are held captive by the speed of light. What we are seeing is a cosmic imprint from thousands and millions of years ago. However, we use the stars to navigate when we are lost. We largely consider stars to be permanent based on the lens of our relatively short life span. Science also tells us that starts are born and die every day – we just won't see much evidence within our life spans! Not even stars, one of our most constant guides, are exempt from the cycles of birth and death.</p><p>A bit closer to home, there are clouds. We are just like clouds. If we look deeply, clouds can teach us how to live. A cloud never holds on to its present form. It may hold a form for a while, but when the environment changes – so does the cloud. A cloud has no choice as to whether it will emit itself to the earth. It has no choice how the emission will be received – rain, sleet, snow? The cloud does its thing and everything else takes care of everything else.</p><p>The Buddha's teaching on mutual co-arising is clearly illuminated by contemplating yourself as a cloud. You are as responsible for our thoughts and feelings as much as a cloud is responsible for the shape it is in. </p><p><i><b>Sidebar</b></i> - That hurts, doesn't it? We are all led to believe that we have so much control over our internal processes when really, our only control lies in the ability to steer the ship and direct "thought traffic". All "unique" ideas are just amalgamations of information smatterings that happen to live in your consciousness. </p><p>As much as it sucks on an egotistical level, considering thoughts this way allows space for love and compassion. Decisions we each make are influenced by the mutual co-arising of countless elements. The mutual co-arising of the entire universe to be more specific. As the Buddha teaches - "this is, so that is".</p><p>When a cloud dissipates, does it really die? The elements of the cloud re-congregate and become something different. Not better, not worse, just different. When parts of the cloud leave the heavens and travel the the earth, it nourishes plants which become our food, it supplies our water reservoirs and gives us hydration, it breaks our dams and takes our lives, it washes away our possessions and yet it shows us the rainbow. </p><p>Each breath you take is in harmony with the formations of the clouds past, present, and future. Our decisions today affect the clouds of tomorrow. </p><p><i><b>Sidebar #2 -</b></i> I think this is what the Buddha means when he teaches the doctrine of looking deeply into life. When you see life this way – you see that you have a part to play and you should damn well own it.</p><p>Buddhist teaching refers to life as a stream of consciousness. My happiness is the same as your happiness – its our happiness. My suffering is of the same nature as your suffering – its our suffering. The stream is a continuum. We love, we laugh, we fear, we fuck, we cry, we make love, we hate, we receive kindness, we smile – we are all part of the same stream.</p><p>Unlike clouds, we have some ability to be a creative force in nature. The nature of life is to co-create by influencing and transforming the energies around us. If we are co-creators, let's learn from the clouds. When the storms of human experience arise, look deeply and realize that clouds don't choose to be thunderstorms. Clouds don't choose to damage our buildings and our bodies with the discharge of electricity. When you see deeply into the nature of life, you will see that our ability to shift the stream of consciousness is individually very limited. This opens up space for love and compassion. When you simply observe the storms of life, realize that they are made up of all of the elements of the universe – be compassion. Be love. That is what we can control. We cannot change the storm, but we can transform the energy of the storm to something more beneficial for all of us.</p><p>As Thich Nhat Hahn says “It takes mud to make a lotus flower.”</p><p>When a storm brews within you. Sit with it and observe. Become love and compassion. Show yourself compassion and love yourself – by loving yourself, you love all of us. By showing yourself compassion, you show all of us compassion.</p></div></section></div><section id="4" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="27"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="29"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="30"><span data-reactid="31"><!-- react-empty: 32 --><h2 data-reactid="33"><a data-reactid="34">When seeking guidance, look to the night sky.</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="35"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="36"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="37"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="38"></div></section></div></div>
