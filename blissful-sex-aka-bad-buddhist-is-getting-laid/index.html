<p>I’ve been having a lot of sex lately. A lot. Like, an inordinate amount. My lack of posting can be directly attributed to my lack of free time due to all of the sex I have been enjoying. Deep, intimate, wet, wild, juicy, passionate, rejuvenating, multi-orgasmic, thoughtful, sex. To say it’s (I’ve) been a wild ride would be an understatement. </p><p>Sadly, circumstances involving a friend who recently got divorced, their 10-year anniversary vacation, and a free cruise in the Caribbean has taken me away from all of the glorious, fulfilling, beautiful, exquisite, hot, sex I have become accustomed to. Therefore, I am posting to this blog. </p><p>In the brief moments over the last few months where I have been able to utilize the functions of my head (the one on my shoulders) I have considered how sex and buddhism intertwine. My main source of inspiration regarding buddhism is Thich Nhat Hahn - a very celebrate monk who only refers to sex when discussing lust and how it takes you out of the present moment. He has not been very inspirational for me during my times of reflection. </p><p>Coincidentally, on the flight taking me away from our respective beds (sex temples), I started listening to an audiobook by the Dalai Lama, How To Practice. I’m fascinated. Tibetan Buddhism is very different from Zen. Very very different. It focuses a lot on cultivating energies rather than simply being with the energies that currently exist and finding silence. </p><p> I was especially shocked when the Dalai Lama starts talking about Tantra. Holy shit!? This awesome yoda-like monk is now talking about “intercourse”. And “sex”. (Unrelated, he says the words “shit” and “piss” in his book - how cool is that?) </p><p>His stance on sex is that it can be a vehicle used to discover emptiness and bliss simultaneously. Wow. What now? I always thought that empty sex was a bad thing! From a buddhist perspective, emptiness doesn’t mean meaningless. Emptiness describes the nature of reality: inter-being. Inner-being, you ask? Does that refer to when your genitals are inside of each other? No. That is a form of inner-being, but that is not what the great monk god-king is referring to. </p><p>The principle of inner-being is this: this is, because that is. Nothing exists independently. Fruit is a great example of inner-being. When you consume an apple, what are you eating? Are you eating an apple? No, not really. What is an apple? It’s an aggregation of seed, soil, water, nutrients, sunlight, and time. When you consume the apple, you are actually consuming the elements that created the apple. The buddhist teaching is to look at everything this way. Nothing exists independent of its elements, and from that perspective - everything is constantly in a state of non-being and inner-being simultaneously. It’s a mind-fuck but its fun. </p><p> So, when the Dalai Lama talks about sex being a vehicle to experience emptiness and bliss, he is referring to the practice of seeing intercourse as a state of inner-being / non-being bliss generation. He describes the concentration on the intention of seeing each sexual movement as an expression of time and space colliding. The subtle energies in the bodies involved can manifest great bliss when sex is approached this way. </p><p>Ok, that’s great. Time and space collide, etc… I know without a doubt that I do not have the level of practice that the Dalai Lama refers to when he describes the level of concentration required to truly practice and experience Tantra. I also am just barely starting to learn about what Tantra is. I’ve got a long way to go. So, in the meantime, I will leave with you with some first-hand experience. I introduce to you: </p><h2>The Bad Buddhist Guide To Empty Blissful Sex (from a man’s perspective) </h2><p> ACT 1 - FOREPLAY </p><p> Foreplay must not be rushed. Take your time. Kiss her, caress her, tease her, take her clothes off - and while you do this, get a sense of her energy. Experience all of her. Consider how every piece of her is a miracle. Consider that her body isn't really hers - its an aggregation of her genetics mixed with the environment. Her body in this moment is the result of her genes, her consumption, and her environment. Consider that her mind is constantly in flux, and right now - you are on the front stage. Her mind is an aggregation of her experiences and the footprints of interactions with others and you have been invited to imprint yourself. Her body and her mind are both miracles of life. As tempting as it may be to just focus on her body - its shape, the way she feels, the way light reflects off of her - spend lots of time with your eyes closed during foreplay simply experiencing her raw energy. For me, energy is perceived as a “field” surrounding her. Explore her energy as you kiss various parts of her body. Kissing her stomach (just below her naval) also helps me get in touch with her energy. From a buddhist perspective, that is where your life energy is stored. Many buddhist teaching refer to visualizing breathing in and out from the chakra just below the naval. </p><p> ACT II - SEXUAL CONTACT </p><p>I personally am a huge huge fan of cunnilingus. The bad buddhist loves to go down. Loves it. </p><p><i> Ahem… I’ll be right back. </i></p><p><i> Sorry - got a little turned on there. All better now. Be sure to check in later for my post on mindful masturbation! </i></p><p> To stay on point, the initial point of sexual contact can be extremely intense. Whatever form you choose, go slow. Rush nothing. I encourage you to not jump straight to intercourse here no matter how badly you want it. Non-intercourse pleasure can be a ton of fun and a great way to observe her energy as you pleasure her. First, gradually transition to your preferred method of sexual contact. Tease her all the way there. Make her energy the object of your mindfulness… meditate on it. As you begin to pleasure her, observe how her energy shifts. With some practice, you should be able to observe what pleasures her based solely on her energy field. The best way I can describe it is in terms of vibration. Let her vibrations climb. You can tell she’s ready to move on by observing her vibrations until they either plateau or she climaxes. The whole time, detach from the outcome of climax. Just enjoy her energy and her vibrations. Enjoy the way you make her “buzz”. Detachment is key. Having the goal of making her climax just adds stress to her life. I don’t know much about the female orgasm, but I do understand that it is complicated and mythical process; and doesn’t always happen. All you can do is be you and enjoy every part of the experience. </p><p>ACT III - CONNECTING </p><p> Connecting sexually is a beautiful experience to say the least. Notice how I made the title “connecting” and not “entering her vagina”, or “bang time”. This is one of the most magic and sensual parts of having sex - the initial connection. At this point, you have been focusing almost exclusively on your partner’s energy. Now, it’s time to shift. In the moments between initial sexual contact and actually gettin’ it on, transition your attention to your energy field. Consider how you are an aggregation of your heritage, your experiences, and your entire life up to this point. </p><p> Good sex is not just about pleasuring your lover, it’s about being vulnerable and open in front of your partner. It’s about being fully you and owning it. Being fully you means to be fully empty. Don't hold on to anything. Just “exist” and make love authentically. </p><p> I’ve struggled with aspect of sex for a long time. The bad buddhist is a giver - it makes him uncomfortable to consider what makes him feel good in bed. It’s time to get over that! Givers, if you are not fully enjoying your body and are not in-tune with what your body wants, your partner won’t get as much out of the experience. Knowing what you want and being present to it does not make you a selfish lover, it actually empties you of agenda. </p><p>To get in touch with your energy, you have to be fairly present in the transition. You may not have a great deal of time, and you want to keep the momentum rolling -<b> so the best approach is not to go into a full lotus posture</b>. Instead, take several moments while you transition slowly and follow your breath: </p><p>breathing in, i am aware there is a body </p><p>breathing out, i feel my body </p><p>breathing in, i am aware of the energies surging in my body </p><p>breathing out, i feel the energies of my body </p><p>breathing in, i am aware of my erect penis (men) </p><p>breathing out, i respect and acknowledge the desires and sensations of my penis (men) </p><p> That last breath is totally situational and is up to you. The gist is, get in touch with your body and give yourself permission to feel good. </p><p>Once you have connected with your energy, its time to connect. Make sexual sensations (for me, it’s my penis) the object of your mindfulness. Feel every sensation available. I prefer for the initial sexual connection to be slow, full of teasing, and face-to-face. Men, feel your penis brush against her as you hover just outside of her vagina, penetrate a bit, pull out a bit, and repeat. I understand that we as men don’t always have control of this experience… sometimes the ladies like to jump on and ride us into the sunset, which is AWESOME. Sometimes she begs you to take her from behind. Regardless, MEN - put your mindfulness in your penis and enjoy every movement (WOMEN - Sorry, don’t mean to leave you out. I’m going to need a co-author to comment on the female experience). In general, start slow and don’t think so much. Just be present to the experiences happening between your legs. </p><p> ACT IV - INTERCOURSE </p><p>We made it, we are in the throws of sex and we are feeling good. Now what? This is where the real magic happens. Your energies have merged. Your body has intimate knowledge of both of your energies at this point and now you have to “trust” that your bodies will not lead you astray. Your mission, maintain mindfulness. Keep your mindfulness on your sexual sensations and physical experience. This portion of the process is immensely personal, so I won’t go in to massive detail here. Instead, I will give some bullet points: </p><p>-Be aware of the energies you are transmuting. Perhaps you’ve had a rough day at work or something in your day made you angry (or she made you angry) - this will certainly present itself in your love making. This may not be a problem, just be aware. When energies merge, you both bring your “stuff” with you. Do your best to see that you are not your stuff. As the buddha teaches, “this is, because that is”. </p><p>-There is no need to be rough. It’s not macho. It’s not manly. Much to my surprise, women can reach climax with the gentlest of movements. I have always channeled a bit of insecurity here. If I am insecure, perhaps I will be a little more aggressive to make sure she is “stimulated” properly. This is not necessary and may actually be detrimental. “Better to err on the side of gentle and ramp up gradually if needed. There is nothing worse than starting at a 10 and having nowhere to go.” - Bad Buddhist (2016) </p><p>-If you orgasm first, you orgasm first. It happens. It doesn’t feel good per-say to be a “quick-trigger”, but just own it. Tell her how great it was and how amazing she is. Give yourself a small break by going down on her a bit more or stimulating her gently with your fingers, and re-connect when you are ready. When you are fully present to your energy during intercourse, you should be able to feel when you are close. Just slow down a bit if you are not ready, or pull out for a few moments. Don’t feel bad! Your vulnerability makes you who you are and makes you an authentic lover. </p><p>Detach from expectations. Just like you can’t always control when and if you orgasm, you certainly can’t control when and if your partner orgasms. It’s challenging since society tells us we should be goal-oriented, but you have to detach from what “the man” teaches us to make us feel bad and sell us products. Any time you start to wonder if your partner is close or if you are close - just go back to the present sexual sensation. Move yourself in a way that makes you feel the best you possibly can and have faith that it is exactly what you both need. Allow your partner to do the same. </p><p> ACT V - CLIMAX </p><p>Great news everyone - both men and women are capable of climaxing multiple times!! It’s wonderful. If you are not used to doing this, it might take some practice - but from experience, being mindful opens the doorway of opportunity (especially for us men). When you are mindful of the present sexual sensations, your body won’t care if it has already climaxed. All your body knows is here and now. I was completely caught off guard when for a good week or so, I was having multiple orgasms as the norm during each sexual encounter (multiple times daily). I wasn’t taking any strange supplements or doing anything different in my diet. Quite by accident, I was present in the moment because I was having so much fun. Every movement was blissful and I didn’t expect to climax again - but I did. Again. And Again. Don’t get me wrong, there was a refractory period. But during that time, I would do something else for a bit. At a certain point (can’t say when, exactly) in the last two months, our bodies became so synchronized that we both climaxed simultaneously leaving us completely satisfied with one orgasm each… but if the energy is available, multiples are in the cards. </p><p> It’s not news that women can climax multiple times. It’s a wonderful feature of their bodies. They just keep coming. Over and over again. </p><p>Rawr. Be right back…. </p><p>Ok, better. Got some more information for that blog-post I mentioned earlier. </p><p>I’m just here to set the record straight, Men - we can do it too. Here is a mindfulness exercise you can try: </p><p> After climaxing, rest for a moment - then identify your favorite part of her body (this can change daily). Simply rest your head near that area and make it the object of your mindfulness. Tease it with your fingers. Caress it gently. As you meditate, get back in touch with the energy resting just above her body. Ask yourself what her vibrations feels like. Leave your expectations in the past and just ask “what is her energy like right now?”. From there, your body will tell you what to do. Odds are, you are both ready for round two. Start from the top. Kiss her and tell her how beautiful she is. Get in touch with every sensation. </p><p> SUMMARY </p><p>I know this isn’t tantra, but it’s my experience with mindful sex. I think this can be a great practice for learning about yourself and experiencing very powerful energies. I think the process can be summarized with a few bullets: </p><p>Smile, breathe, and go slowly. </p><p>Take your time getting started, foreplay is not about sexual arousal as much as it is about connecting your energies. </p><p>Don’t get lost in the experience, stay mindful. </p><p>Above all, to thyself be true. </p><p>Find the bliss in every movement. It’s there. </p><p>Detach from goals and expectations. </p><p> This concludes the Bad Buddhist’s Guide To Empty Blissful Sex. </p><p>--</p><p>I realize there are a good number of topics not covered - but I will leave that to you. I think my point here is that sex and buddhism can be very deeply connected if we allow them to be. Using mindfulness, there is no reason we can’t use sex as a very blissful meditation practice. Now, I just need to get off of this damn boat and get home to my beautiful and delicious girlfriend and go on a meditation retreat! </p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="29"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="30"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="31"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="32"><span data-reactid="33"><!-- react-empty: 34 --><h2 data-reactid="35"><a data-reactid="36"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="37"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="38"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="39"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="40"></div></section></div></div>
